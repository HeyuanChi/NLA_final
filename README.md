# NLA_final

This project is the solution to the Programming-Exam of the lecture NLA in Heidelberg University.

We implemented how to transform a Hermitian matrix into a real trigonometric form using Householder reflection and then compute all eigenvalues ​​and eigenvectors via shifted QR iteration and deflation.
